# Incomplete Cooperative Game

Usage for now:
```bash
python -m incomplete_cooperative --number-of-players=4 learn --run-steps-limit=5
python -m incomplete_cooperative --number-of-players=4 evaluate --run-steps-limit=5
```

For more info, do:
```bash
python -m incomplete_cooperative -h
```

There is also a utility script for drawing a graph. Run:
```bash
./scripts/exploitability_combiner.py <dir>
```
where `dir` (or its subdirs) contain a `data.json` file generated by this
program. In that directory, a combined graph of exploitabilities will be saved.
