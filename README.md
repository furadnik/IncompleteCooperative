# Incomplete Cooperative Game

## Installation

This package can be installed for example using
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), by running:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/DavidSych/IncompleteCooperative
```

## Usage

To use the learning/evaluating script, run:
```bash
incomplete_cooperative --number-of-players=4 learn --run-steps-limit=5
incomplete_cooperative --number-of-players=4 evaluate --run-steps-limit=5
```

For more info, do:
```bash
incomplete_cooperative -h
```

There is also a utility script for drawing a graph. Run:
```bash
icg_exploitability_combiner <dir> <title>
```
where `dir` (or its subdirs) contain a `data.json` file generated by this
program and `title` is the title of the figure. In that directory, a combined
graph of exploitabilities will be saved.

Also, after training, it is recommended to run the following script:
```bash
icg_validator <dir>
```
where `dir` is the same as before. This checks if the results match what is
expected.
